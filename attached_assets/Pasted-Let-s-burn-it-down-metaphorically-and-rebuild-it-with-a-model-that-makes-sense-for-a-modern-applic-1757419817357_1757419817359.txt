Let's burn it down (metaphorically) and rebuild it with a model that makes sense for a modern application. MongoDB's document model allows us to create rich, intuitive objects that map directly to what you're using in your code.

Why We're Breaking Up with SQL (for this project)
Intuitive Data Model: A student isn't a dozen rows in a dozen tables. A student is a single document containing their information, their grades, and their parent's details. You fetch one document, you get the whole picture.

Fewer Collections, More Sense: We can consolidate many of your tables (homework, materials, tests, lessonPlans) into a single, logical collection. This reduces complexity everywhere.

Performance: Retrieving one embedded document is almost always faster than performing multiple joins. For the read-heavy nature of a school management app, this is a huge win.

Flexibility: Need to add extracurricular activities to a student? Just add a new field to their document. No complex database migrations (ALTER TABLE...) needed.

The New Blueprint: A Lean, Mean MongoDB Schema
Here is a complete, redefined schema to guide your migration.

1. schools Collection
This remains the top-level document, but it's cleaner.

JSON

{
  "_id": "ObjectId('school123')",
  "name": "Northwood High",
  "address": "123 Main St, Anytown",
  "contact": {
    "email": "contact@northwood.edu",
    "phone": "555-1234"
  },
  "createdAt": "ISODate('2025-01-01T10:00:00Z')"
}
2. users Collection
The single source of truth for every person in the system. No more duplication. This collection holds login info and a profile sub-document that contains role-specific data.

JSON

{
  "_id": "ObjectId('user456')",
  "email": "jane.doe@example.com",
  "password": "hashed_password_goes_here",
  "schoolId": "ObjectId('school123')",
  "role": "teacher", // enum: ['super_admin', 'school_admin', 'teacher', 'student', 'parent']
  "profile": {
    "fullName": "Jane Doe",
    "phone": "555-5678",
    "joiningDate": "ISODate('2022-08-15T00:00:00Z')", // For teachers
    "subjectSpecialization": ["Mathematics", "Physics"], // For teachers
    "dob": "ISODate('1990-05-20T00:00:00Z')" // For students
  },
  "classId": "ObjectId('class789')", // Only for students

}
3. classes Collection
Stores class information and maintains a simple list of student and teacher references.

JSON

{
  "_id": "ObjectId('class789')",
  "schoolId": "ObjectId('school123')",
  "grade": "10",
  "section": "A",
  "classTeacherId": "ObjectId('user456')", // Ref to a user with role 'teacher'
  "subjects": [
    {
      "subjectId": "ObjectId('subjMath101')",
      "subjectName": "Mathematics",
      "teacherId": "ObjectId('user456')"
    },
    {
      "subjectId": "ObjectId('subjPhy101')",
      "subjectName": "Physics",
      "teacherId": "ObjectId('user456')"
    }
  ]
}
4. academics Collection ✨ The Big One ✨
This is the magic. We're consolidating homework, tests, materials, and lessonPlans into one collection. A type field distinguishes them, but the core structure is the same, dramatically simplifying your backend logic and API.

JSON

{
  "_id": "ObjectId('acadItem001')",
  "schoolId": "ObjectId('school123')",
  "classId": "ObjectId('class789')",
  "subjectId": "ObjectId('subjMath101')",
  "teacherId": "ObjectId('user456')",
  "type": "homework", // enum: ['homework', 'test', 'material', 'lesson_plan']
  "title": "Algebra Chapter 5 Problems",
  "description": "Complete all odd-numbered questions.",
  "assignedDate": "ISODate('2025-09-10T00:00:00Z')",
  "dueDate": "ISODate('2025-09-12T00:00:00Z')",
  "attachmentUrl": "https://example.com/homework.pdf",
  // Type-specific fields
  "maxMarks": 100, // For 'test'
  "materialType": "notes" // For 'material'
}
5. attendance Collection
Optimized for easy querying. Each document represents a single day for a class, which is much more efficient than one row per student per day.

JSON

{
  "_id": "ObjectId('attnd001')",
  "schoolId": "ObjectId('school123')",
  "classId": "ObjectId('class789')",
  "date": "ISODate('2025-09-09T00:00:00Z')",
  "records": [
    {
      "studentId": "ObjectId('student001')",
      "status": "present" // enum: ['present', 'absent', 'late']
    },
    {
      "studentId": "ObjectId('student002')",
      "status": "absent"
    }
  ]
}
